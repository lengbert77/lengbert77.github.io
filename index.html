									</header>
									<p style="text-indent: 40px">As a lifetime resident of the beautiful state of Virginia, I have spent most of my life living either
									in or around the city of Fredericksburg. I currently reside in Fredericksburg with my wife, and work for 
									the <a href = "https://www.pwcsa.org/" target = "_blank">Prince William County Service Authority</a>,
									in addition to attending online grad classes at Old Dominion University (ODU). I completed my undergrad at
									the University of Mary Washington (UMW), and have also taken several non-degree classes through Northern Virginia
									Community College and Germanna. Some topics that I have especially enjoyed studying and putting into practice
									professionally are Python programming and spatial analysis.<br></p>
									
									<p style="text-indent: 40px">Some of my personal interests include biking (I once completed a "Century ride", which 
									was 100 miles in one day),
									weightlifting, science fiction (especially Star Wars, Star Trek, and Dr. Who), and outdoor activities of all kinds.
									I also enjoy all kinds of music from country to classical, and everything in between. I have been playing the violin for 
									close to 20 years, in addition to having participated in various choirs and choruses throughout the 
									years. I am also an active volunteer with my wife as a leader for the youth group at our local church.<br></p>

									<h3>Education and Work Experience</h3>
									<p>As an undergraduate, I majored in Geography, minored in Data Science, and also earned a certificate in GIS. 
									My undergrad background in Data Science is what led me to begin pursuing my M.S. in Data Science and Analytics.
									Professionally, I have now been working almost 3 years for the Prince William County Service Authority as a GIS Technician</p>
